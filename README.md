The main motive to take this topic as a project is to create one app that has all the daily updates that we have to know. Like due to the coronavirus pandemic everyone wants to know the exact real time data about the pandemic. So for this we are taking live data from the open API and parsing the JSON data  in the app so you can get a live update with a single click. The API updates the server in every 10 minutes you will get the real time data about the coronavirus. 
Weather is very common and day to day uses of features in today’s era. We planned out upcoming events according to the weather forecast and that's why it's very useful information that we all need.  So here we are parsing the live data from the open weather API through our App. You can also search your city from the app and it will show you the current weather of your city. We also included news feeds directly from google with Web View so you can scroll the news all around the world or you can login for personal recommending news feeds.
